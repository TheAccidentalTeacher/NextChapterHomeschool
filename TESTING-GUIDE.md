## Test Flow — Full Game Loop

### Phase 1: Teacher Login & Game Creation

1. **Open the app** — Go to the landing page (`/`)
2. **Click "Student / Teacher Login"** — Goes to `/sign-in`
3. **Sign in as `scott` / `ClassCiv2026!`**
4. **Expected:** Redirects to `/dm` (DM Overview page)
   - If you see `/dashboard` instead, the middleware redirect isn't working. Try navigating directly to `/dm`.
5. **Click "+ New Game"** (or go to `/dm/setup`)
6. **Fill in the form:**
   - Game Name: `Test Game — Spring 2026`
   - Class Period: `6th Grade`
   - Round Timer: 8 minutes (default)
   - Epoch Count: 15 (default)
   - Victory Conditions: leave all checked
7. **Click "Create Game"**
8. **Expected:** Redirects back to `/dm` with the new game card visible

**Verification:**
- [ ] Teacher lands on `/dm` after login
- [ ] Game creation form works
- [ ] New game appears in the DM overview list

Test each DM tool on the game management page:

#### Intel Drop
1. **Open "Intel Drop" form** on the DM game page
2. **Select a team** and type a message
3. **Send** — Message goes to that team only
4. **As student on that team** — Check for the `IntelDropModal` appearing

## Troubleshooting

### "Already signed in" loop
Clerk says `<SignIn/>` can't render when already signed in. This is normal — navigate directly to `/dm` (teacher) or `/dashboard` (student).

### Teacher stuck on `/dashboard`
The middleware should redirect teachers to `/dm`. If it doesn't:
- Verify the user's `publicMetadata.role` is `"teacher"` in Clerk dashboard
- Check the middleware is deployed (latest commit includes the fix using `clerkClient()`)

### Map not rendering
Leaflet requires CSS to be loaded. Check:
- The `MapWrapper` component handles SSR-safe dynamic import
- Browser console for missing CSS/JS errors

### Submissions not showing in queue
- Verify the student is on a team (`/api/me/team` returns data)
- Check the epoch is on the correct round phase
- The submission queue polls every 5 seconds

### Database errors
- Check Supabase dashboard → Table Editor for data
- Verify RLS policies allow the operation
- Check the Supabase project is active (free tier pauses after inactivity)

---

## Creating Additional Test Users

### Via PowerShell (Windows)

```powershell
$secret = (Get-Content ".env.local" | Where-Object { $_ -match '^CLERK_SECRET_KEY=' }) -replace 'CLERK_SECRET_KEY=',''
$headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $secret"; "Content-Type" = "application/json" }
$body = '{"username":"newstudent","password":"ClassCiv2026!","public_metadata":{"role":"student"}}'
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.clerk.com/v1/users" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body
```

### Via cURL (Mac/Linux)

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.clerk.com/v1/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLERK_SECRET_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"newstudent","password":"ClassCiv2026!","public_metadata":{"role":"student"}}'
```

## Console Warnings (Safe to Ignore)

| Warning | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| `Clerk has been loaded with development keys` | Using Clerk dev instance — expected in dev/staging |
| `[DOM] Input elements should have autocomplete attributes` | Clerk's internal form inputs — not our code |
| `<SignIn/> component cannot render when user is already signed in` | Navigating to `/sign-in` while logged in — redirect is working |

## Simulation Engine — Automated Full-Game Testing

The simulation engine runs 36 simulated students across 6 teams through a complete game — exercising all game mechanics end-to-end against live Supabase.

### Running a Simulation

> **Important:** All commands must be run from the `classroom-civ/` directory.

```bash
# Quick 3-epoch test
npx tsx scripts/simulate.ts --fast --epochs 3

# Full 8-epoch simulation (default)
npx tsx scripts/simulate.ts --fast --epochs 8

# Dry run (simulates everything but writes nothing to DB)
npx tsx scripts/simulate.ts --dry-run
```

### What It Tests

- **Epoch State Machine:** All 11 steps per epoch (login → build → build_routing → expand → expand_routing → define → define_routing → defend → defend_routing → resolve → exit)
- **Question Selector:** Picks contextually appropriate questions based on round type, epoch, and team state
- **Yield Calculator:** Full yield formula with justification multiplier, d20 roll, terrain bonuses
- **Resource Routing:** Each team's lead role allocates yields across spend/contribute/bank
- **Population Engine:** Food-driven growth, famine at food ≤ 0, population loss
- **Bank Decay:** 10% per epoch on banked resources
- **Dark Ages:** Trigger check (combined famine + war exhaustion + depletion)

### What to Expect

| Epochs | Students | Submissions | ~Time (fast mode) |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 3 | 36 | 432 | ~50 seconds |
| 8 | 36 | 1,152 | ~2 minutes |

### Cleaning Up Simulation Data

```bash
# Delete a specific simulation game and all its data
npx tsx scripts/simulate.ts --cleanup GAME_ID
```

The game ID is printed at the end of every simulation run. Simulation log files are saved to `simulation-log-{gameId}.txt` and are gitignored.

### Verified Results (March 6, 2026)

- **3-epoch test:** PASSED — 6 teams, 36 students, 432 submissions, 50.6s
- **8-epoch test:** PASSED — 6 teams, 36 students, 1,152 submissions, 121.1s
- All game mechanics working: yields, routing, population, famine, bank decay, epoch transitions
- By epoch 8, all teams hit famine (population → 1) because purchase menu (Phase 7) isn't built yet — no way to buy farms

*This guide covers Phases 0-6 + Simulation Engine of the ClassCiv build. Additional testing for Phases 7+ (purchases, d20 events, tech tree, trade, wonders, NPCs) will be added as those features are built.*
